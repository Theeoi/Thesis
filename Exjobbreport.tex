\chapter*{Popular Science Summary}
\subsection*{A New Frontier of Computing}
We all recognize the feeling of panic when your computer crashes and you realize
you forgot to save your progress for the past couple of hours. In this scenario
you wait for the computer to boot again and assess what you have lost. Imagine
instead the computer booting instantly and you find yourself exactly where you
left off. With an emerging technology in computer design this could become the
new reality.

The basic idea behind the fundamental building block of your electronic devices,
known as the transistor, has since its invention in the 1960s been largely
unchanged. The design which proved most successful is known as the
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) and is by far the
most common design even to this day due to its cheap manufacturing process and
its ability to be scaled down to ever smaller devices. However, in the last
decade one has started to reach the limits of the MOSFET design, primarily due
to limited scalability, and alternative designs are actively being explored.

A promising design is the Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction (FTJ) which utilizes the
small dimensions of the transistor to its advantage where electrons tunnel
through a thin barrier. This barrier is then manipulated to either allow
electrons though or not, resulting in the characteristic transistor
functionality. In addition to being intrinsically small, the ferroelectric
barrier allows the transistor to be toggleable where the state of the transistor
is maintained even though power is lost. This ability means that electronic
devices utilizing this design does not have to be booted up, as all transistors
are already set to the desired state. Additionally, as power is only consumed as
transistors are being toggled between states, these devices could reduce power
consumption lengthening the battery life across all devices.

However, for this to become the new reality of computers, the FTJ design must be
improved further to prove as an effective alternative to the MOSFET design. One
limiting factor is believed to be the interfaces of the ferroelectric barrier
layer. Utilizing a new technique known as Flash-Lamp Annealing (FLA) the
processing of the ferroelectric barrier layer can be made up to 10 000 times
faster which could significantly improve the interfaces. This as the material
can set much faster resulting in better defined interfaces. If successful, this
could be a crucial step for this new transistor design to become a viable
alternative to MOSFETs and bring in a new frontier of computing.

\section{Flashlamp Intensity and Film Temperature}
Crystallization of the hafnia films using the flash lamp annealing (FLA)
technique does not immediately reveal the temperature achieved in the films. Due
to the short time frames and the geometry of the FLA setup, one must simulate
the achieved temperature in the film from the structure of the samples and the
flash parameters. Flash duration and preheating temperature were set to
\SI{5}{\milli\second} and \SI{250}{\celsius} respectively in order to be below
the critical crystallization temperature before the FLA
flash \cite{migita2019phase}. Other simulation parameters are tabulated in
table \ref{tab:app_simparam} and produce figure \ref{fig:res_Comsol} showing the
resulting back and front peak temperature for different pulse energies. The figure also
includes pyrometer measurements of the back temperature during annealing
(green). The discrepancies on the order of \SI{20}{\kelvin} between simulated
back peak temperature (black) and the measured values are attributed to a 
lower reflectivity of the \ce{TiN} capping layer compared to the ideal values of
the simulation. Therefore, the model is deemed to be in reasonable agreement
with the experimental data and gives an estimate of the achieved surface peak temperature.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.41\linewidth]{fig/COMSOLFlashInt.png}
    \caption{Simulated back and front peak temperatures of our samples using the
    simulation parameters tabulated in \ref{tab:app_simparam}. Pyrometer
    measurements of the back temperature measured during annealing (green) confirm
    the accuracy of these simulations.}\label{fig:res_Comsol}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:res_Comsol} reveal a linear relationship between the pulse
energy ($E_{pulse}$) and the peak HZO film temperature ($T_{peak}$) for our
sample and FLA parameters (eq~\ref{eq:app_filmtemp}). This gives a more
convenient reference going forward using the achieved film temperature rather
than the pulse energy when describing different samples. The usually reported
crystallization temperature required to form the ferroelectric orthorhombic
phase of HZO is in the range of 400-\SI{600}{\celsius}
\cite{muller2012ferroelectricity, athle2022improved}.
The simulated peak surface temperatures in the
20-\SI{30}{\joule\per\square\centi\meter} pulse energy range are significantly
above this critical temperature and should therefore yield a sufficiently high
peak temperature to achieve ferroelectric properties in the HZO.

\section{Sample Specifications and Characterization}
As a reference point, samples were processed using rapid thermal processing
(RTP) as the annealing method in parallell to the FLA samples. These samples
proves as a point of comparison for the characterization of the FLA samples
throughout the work. The RTP samples were annealed at a temperature of
\SI{600}{\celsius} for 30 seconds. The electrical characterization of these
samples, as described in Chapter \ref{ch:char}, were measured and
tabulated in table \ref{tab:res_RTPref}. The remnant polarization and coercive
field are measured after a wakeup of $10^4$ cycles at a pulsing voltage of
\SI{3}{\volt}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Electrical characteristics for the RTP reference samples.}\label{tab:res_RTPref}

%RTP) is fabricated on similar substrates etc? Refering to a table in the
%appendix! Maybe we could ensure the reader in the fabrication section and then
%refirm with a small sentence here.

The processing of the FLA samples are outlined in Section \ref{sec:FabProc}. For
the first FLA series, hereby denoted sample series 1, the flash intensity was
varied between 15-\SI{32.5}{\joule\per\centi\meter\squared} to reach different peak
temperatures in the film. The film deposition and annealing conditions for these
samples are summarized in table \ref{tab:res_IntC}.

        Number of Flashes & & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Resulting electrical characterization from sample series 1 are shown in
figure \ref{fig:res_IntC}. As seen in figure \ref{fig:res_IntCPr} and
\ref{fig:res_IntCEc} the PUND characteristics show ferroelectric behaviour with
a strong dependence on peak film temperature. The onset of ferroelectricity for
these flashlamp annealed samples seem to be at a peak temperature between
550-\SI{630}{\celsius}. Therefore samples annealed with an intensity less than
\SI{25}{\joule/\centi\meter\squared} are omitted from some of the figures.
The remnant polarization and the coercive fields of these samples follow a similar
pattern reaching a peak of $20.12 \pm 0.59$ \si{\micro\coulomb\per\centi\meter\squared} and a
minimum of $1.46 \pm 0.14$ \si{\mega\volt\per\centi\meter} respectively at a peak
annealing temperature of \SI{711}{\celsius}. Higher temperature annealing
shows a degradation of these ferroelectric properties. %TODO: Why?

Figures \ref{fig:res_IntCPr} and \ref{fig:res_IntCEc} shows that the
described experimental process in Chapter \ref{ch:fab} is indeed a valid process for
fabricating ferroelectric capacitors of this caliber with comparable remnant
polarization and coercive fields to that of samples annealed through RTP.

        Figure c and d show improved endurance and reduced defect density
        respectively for all samples annealed through FLA compared to the RTP
        sample.}\label{fig:res_IntC}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, figure \ref{fig:res_IntCEndu} show an increased endurance for
sample series 1 compared to the RTP reference. The comparable sample 4 flashed
with \SI{30}{\joule\per\centi\meter\squared} had a endurance roughly 6 times
greater at values in the range $(127 \pm 13)$ $\cdot 10^3$ cycles. The barely
ferroelectric sample 3 flashed at \SI{25}{\joule\per\centi\meter\squared}
did not breakdown before the measurements ended at $200$ $\cdot 10^3$ cycles and
the endurance of these capacitors should be investigated further to reach a
conclusion for their viability for use in certain gate stacks \cite{dawber2005physics}.
Similarly to $P_r$ and $E_c$, annealing at a higher peak temperature results in degraded
endurance to a value of $(82 \pm 46)$ $\cdot 10^3$ cycles. These values however
are still an improvement compared to the RTP sample.

The improved endurance could be a result of the reduced defect density of the
flash lamp annealed films as shown in figure \ref{fig:res_IntCDD} using the
method described in section \ref{sec:CV}. The measurements reveal a defect
reduction of up to a factor of 3 for sample 3 and close to a factor of 2 for
sample showing comparable $P_r$ and $E_c$ to the RTP sample. This is likely due
to the reduced thermal budget for the FLA samples which generates less initial
defects during the annealing step. However, after sufficiently many cycles the
generated defects (vacancies) start to collect at the \ce{HZO} grain boundaries
increasing the leakage through the oxide and causes the breakdown. However,
the data studied here is not enough to rigorously conclude these theories
\cite{pesic2016physical, athle2022improved}. See table \ref{tab:res_series1} for
a summary of the attained values.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \caption{Electrical characteristics for sample 4 in sample series
    1. See table \ref{tab:res_IntC} for processing conditions.}\label{tab:res_series1}
    \begin{tabular}{rlrl}
        \toprule
        \multicolumn{4}{c}{PUND, Endurance and Defect Density}\\\midrule
        Remnant Polarization & $P_r$ & $20.12 \pm 0.59$ &
        \si{\micro\coulomb\per\centi\meter\squared}\\
        Coercive Field & $E_c$ & $1.46 \pm 0.14$ & \si{\mega\volt\per\centi\meter}\\
        Endurance & & $127 \pm 13$ & $10^3$ cycles\\
        Defect Density & $D_d$ & $6.1 \pm 0.7$ & $10^{12}$
        \si{\per\centi\meter\squared}
        \\\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Although sample series 1 resulted in improved endurance and lower defect density
along with comparable PUND data to the RTP samples, the peak annealing
temperature is still to high in order to significantly reduce the amount of
defects in the film. A closer look at figure \ref{fig:res_IntCDD} and the barely
ferroelectric sample 3 annealed at a flash intensity of
\SI{25}{\joule\per\centi\meter\squared} reveal a further reduction of the defect
density at the cost of ferroelectric response (figure \ref{fig:res_IntCPr}).
Maintaining that low peak annealing temperature over multiple flashes could
result in improved PUND data while not inducing additional defects.

For sample series 2 and 3, tabulated in table \ref{tab:res_NumA} and
\ref{tab:res_NumC} respectively, the number of flashes were varied up to a
maximum of 8 flashes for two different peak annealing temperatures at the onset
of crystallization. The flashes were manually timed at an interval of
approximately \SI{200}{\second}.

Resulting electrical characteristics of sample series 2 and 3 are shown in
figures \ref{fig:res_NumACPUND} and \ref{fig:res_NumACEnduDD}. Figure
\ref{fig:res_NumACPr} reveal an increased ferroelectric response with
additional flashes up to a maximum of $22.98 \pm 1.02$
\si{\micro\coulomb\per\centi\meter\squared} for sample series 2. Sample series 3
on the other hand is not annealed to a significantly high peak temperature to
achieve ferroelectricity until 8 flashes; but even then not to a significant
degree. Sample series 2 show a similar degradation of the ferroelectric response
when flashing up to 8 times as with the increased flash intensity in figure
\ref{fig:res_IntCPr}. % TODO: Same as for IntC, why do we think this is?
The achieved coercive field as shown in figure \ref{fig:res_NumACEc} is
comparable with both sample series 1 and the RTP sample.

    results in comparable ferroelectric response to the RTP sample as tabulated
    in table \ref{tab:res_RTPref}.}\label{fig:res_NumACPUND}
\end{figure}

Similarly to sample series 1, figure \ref{fig:res_NumACEnduDD} show increased
endurance as well as a lower defect density compared to the RTP sample. Sample 4
of sample series 2 which has the most similar ferroelectric response to the RTP
sample had an endurance in the range $(53 \pm 11)$ $\cdot 10^3$ cycles; an
improvement of a factor of 2. Other samples in the same series showed longer
endurances but at the cost of remnant polarization. More interestingly, the
defect density of sample series 2 shown in figure \ref{fig:res_NumADD} does
increase with multiple flashes reaching a saturated value at 4 flashes an
beyond. This gives indication for the peak annealing temperature of
\SI{630}{\celsius} still being to high in order to avoid the diffusion of
defects in the samples. After 4 flashes the defect density reaches a saturated
value where additional flashes only affects the already generated defects and
assists in the pinning of the domains lowering $P_r$ as shown in figure
\ref{fig:res_IntCPr}.

Sample series 3 does not give any ferroelectric response until the 8th flash as
shown in figure \ref{fig:res_NumACPr}. This is likely due to the low total
thermal impact of the \SI{5}{\milli\second} pulses at this peak annealing
temperature. However, as indicated by figure \ref{fig:res_NumCDD}, the defect
density of these samples also increase with additional flashes, reaching
approximately the same value as for sample series 2 but showing a significantly
lower ferroelectric response. This implies the total energy deposited in the
samples during flashing is enough to induce additional defects but barely enough
to crystallize the HZO to the orthorhombic phase. See table
\ref{tab:res_series2} for a summary of the attained values for sample series 2.

    affects the defect density up to a point where additional flashes only assists
    in pinning the ferroelectric domains. The measured endurance of these samples
