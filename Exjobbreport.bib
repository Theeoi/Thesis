Paper laying the foundation for FLA processing of HZO films. Showing that it is
possible with a MIM structure and achieved similar results to their RTP
processed sample. Contains a bunch of good sources for the basics of HZO and how
FLA might improve these devices.
Key takeaways:
- HfO2 already used in CMOS processing --> good compatibility.
- They show that the preheating temperature is insufficient for crystallization
(375C). I should do the same!
- CV peaks coincide with Ec. Capacitance increases as charges move (switching).
- Cites many sources for why the graphs look like they do. Worth to check out!

Demonstrating the possibility to achieve 1nm thin films of FE HZO. Deposited
directly on Si and using SiO2 as bilayer. Not very good devices but achieves a
good TER but low endurance at a suboptimal cycle-voltage (2.5V). They argue that
for such thin films 2.5V is fine and one can trade TER for better endurance. The
paper also contains a lot of interesting sources which gives a full picture of
the field.
Key takeaways:
- FTJs typically suffer from low read current which is cruical for readout.
- Read voltage must be well below the coercive field and yield a large current.
With the large bandgap of HfO2 we hence must have ultrathin films.
- They try to 'distangle' the mechanisms which could influence the hysteresis to
prove that it is realy ferroelectric. Does any such mechanics come into play
with my devices?
- This shows the possibility --> further research is required.

A review on the state of FTJs from 2014. No mention of HZO and much focus on the
ON/OFF ratio of the ferroelectric materials of the time. Has some good figures
in the beginning explaining how the FE controls tunneling and mentions the
different tunneling mechanics.
Key takeaways:
- FeRAMs are commencially available. Bulky (>100nm) and troublesum to read from.
- FTJs have good ON/OFF ratios and give non-destructive readout.
- There are three main tunneling mechanics (Direct, Fowler-Nordheim and
Thermionic)
- The polarisation is not completely screened which gives bandbending in the
electrodes --> If the screening length is different between the electrodes, this
can be used to control tunneling.
- The concept of FTJs was proposed 1971 but was forgotten since it was believed
to not work on small structures. The FE on ultrathin films was then demostrated
in 2009.
- There were issues with the endurance with these types of FTJs aswell (<10⁶)
- Combining FE with Ferromagnetic electrodes gives special interactions. Mention
as an application in my introduction?

Great paper giving insight into the HfO/InAs interface. They manage to deposit
HfO on InAs with a sharp interface and investigates the interface structure both
before and efter annealing. Through annealing the In and As diffuse though the
HfO to form various oxides on the surface (away from the InAs/HfO interface).
Key takeaways:
- Elemental As in the HfO/InAs interface are inevitable and cause midgap and
oxide charge traps.
- D_it is substantially increased post annealing. Likely due to diffusion.
- D_it is calculated through a classical method. Different from our UniCV?
- AsOx are not formed in ALD as it is unstable below 315C. Must come from
annealing.
- AsOx and InOx are found on the SURFACE after annealing. This is due to
diffusion which is time dependant --> fast annealing required.
- The band diagram post annealing is diffucult to determine due to these
defects.
- To decrease the diffusion one could decrease the annealing time and passivate
the InAs surface.

Lengthy review with a focus on the FLA technique. The applications brought up are
not very relevant but the technical information and comparission with RTP is.
Also brings up the main advantages and concerns regarding the FLA technique.
Key takeaways:
- RTP has been enough for the CMOS industry a long time which is why it is a
standard.
- One could combine the ALD process with a FLA and crystallize the HZO during
growth. Maybe an outlook from my thesis?
- Use this paper to discuss some technical parameters of out FLA and ensure the
reader that they are considered.
- Energy density and pulse duration are the main parameters for temperature
control.

Paper giving an overview of the concepts of FE from its conception in the 1950s.
A lot of historical facts of emerging technologies with a focus on the main 3
implementations of FE in gatestacks (FTJs being one of them). Concluding with
the fact that HfO has revitilized the interest in FE devices.
Key takeaways:
- 2011 was the kickoff of HfO-based ferroelectrics.
- In HfO it is the oxygen ions which do the switching. Non-centrosymmetry is
required!
- FTJs are not very common in applications. FeRAM and FeFETs have been realised.
- Before HfO, there was scaling and integration issues with all ferroelectric materials.
- HfO has greater Ec compared to traditional FE materials. This causes high
electrical field stress during switching in the materials used which introduces
charge trapping and is limiting endurance.
- AntiFE usually has greater endurance. One can shift the AntiFE hysteresis to
achieve non-volatility.
- The idea of FTJs was born in 1971. But requires thin films.
- FTJs are in basic research and is usually demonstrated on very simple
configurations.
- Oxide bilayer is primarily introduced to reduce unwanted current through FTJs.
This however limits current density.
- There are competing NVM technologies however the low writing energy for FEs is
superior.

Compact paper describing the success of integrating FE Si:HfO in real
production. They made MIM-caps that proved realy good with endurances up to
10^12 at 3V. They go further implementing Nanosecond Laser Annealing to further
improve these devices by "engineering" the crystallisation step.
Key takeaways:
- Thermal budget is not only important for crystalisation it is also of major
concern for the other components present on a chip.
- Capacitor area scaling can greatly improve the characteristics. This is why it
is important to stick to a specific size. It is theorized to be this way due to
stress-effects.

A description of the uni-directional CV method for determining defect densities
of oxides. Compares with the traditional bi-directional CV method and gives
insight into the workings of both methods and how they complement eachother.
Somewhat unclear if this is in contradiction to Robins explaination in
Athle2022improved.
Key takeaways:
- The hysteresis in the uni-CV method is both time and voltage dependant since
even if the fermi level changes due to a change in voltage the trapping time
constant determines if a trap is active of not.
- The equation used (eq1) assumes a chargesheet --> Numbers could be
underestimations of the true defect density.
- The hysteresis can arrise from the ferroelectric switching as well. We must
hence be very careful not to go above the coercive field.
- Improved performance could also be achieved by moving the trap energies away
from the bandgap. However, the voltage required to write to FeFETs are generally
higher which means we must also redice the defect density.
- Bi-CV gives a depth profile on the order of a couple of nm (bulk) while the
uni-CV takes everything (including interfaces). Through both methods we can find
that the majority of defects are located at the interface.
- The defect density at the interfaces does not change significantly between 10
to 10^6 cycles which means the degradation of the memory window is probably due
to bulk defects pinning the FE domains. However, the uni-method should be able
to see these defects aswell but the defect could be out of the time window for
the measurements.

Great paper discussing the effects of time and temperature on the
crystallization of HZO films through phase transitions. They compare FLA, RTP
and Long-Time RTP and investigate the volume fraction of each phase. Many great
insights for why we select certain parameters in my thesis.
Key takeaways:
- The orthorhombic phase appears in a wide range of Zr doping. --> Nice choise.
- Not only composition affects the ferroelectricity. Also annealing temperature.
- One can use the dielectric constant to estimate volume fractions between
orthorhombic/tetragonal to monoclinic. Should we do this?
- A film at 250C for 96h remained amorphous. Good for our preheating
temperature!
- The transformation order is Amorphous -> Tetragonal -> Orthorhombic ->
Monoclinic. We want to maximize the volume fraction of the orthorhombic phase!
- For the O -> M transformation a volume expanssion is required. Metalcapping
can suppress this.
- Due to the volume expanssion, having this films could in itself suppress O ->
M due to interfacial effects.
- Energy gain from O->M in HfO2 is larger than the same transition in ZrO2.
Doping with ZrO2 suppresses the O->M and increases FE.
- The long-term effects of low temperature annealing is important as is plays
a role for the total thermal budget for integration in real circuits. (<300C)

Good paper reporting on ferroelectricity in HfO2 and ZrO2 through varying
composition range. It is theorized a intermediate ferroelectric orthorhombic
phase between the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of both oxides and a mixture
of 50/50 is found to produce the best ferroelectricity.
Key takeaways:
- The volume increase of the monoclinic phase is well known and is used to
toughen steel.
- The composition determines the volume fraction starting point between the
phases. Since HfO2 is primarily monoclinic (most stable) it could be beneficial
to start with a somewhat higher Zr concentration.
- Confinement of the oxide by capping does indeed suppress the monoclinic phase!
- In these early studies it was theorized that oxygen vacancies could be the
source of the ferroelectric behaviour and HZO is nothing cool. However, this is
debunked later.

Not a super relevant paper for my thesis. Used PLA for crystallisation with both
ns and ms pulses. The ns pulses were insufficient for crystallisation while the
ms pulses gave comparable results to RTP and could probably be optimized
further.
Key takeaways:
- PLA gives better control over the crystallisation parameters.
- Pulses shorter than 50ns are insufficient for crystallisation (at least with
realistic thicknesses grown on Si)
- The pulse duration can affect phase composition of the HZO film! This is clear
in classical nucleation theory. Include in thesis?

A somewhat bland paper showing the phase distribution in a pure HfO2 film during
RTP annealing. They vary the ramping temperature to show that faster ramp times
is good for the suppression of the monoclinic phase.
Key takeaways:
- There are several tested techniques for improved crystallization to the
orthorhombic phase. However, RTP and FLA are the most promising.
- Some calculations(?) show that nucleation drives the transformation between
phases in this time scale. Similar calculations have been made for HZO.

Highly technical paper demonstrating that FE can be achieved in a 1nm HZO film.
They utilize various phase symmetries to show that it is indeed ferroelectric
as well as other things. Not very fond of the symmetry-talk so might just be
useful for the conclusions.
Key takeaways:
- Explicit mention of confinement strain to suppress the O->M phase transition.
- These ultra-thin films don't need wakeup due to confinement and thinness. 
- These films show reverse size effects oppose to conventional perovskite
crystals. Thin films are good!

An expansion upon my thesis work. Includes everything I did and some XPS.
Many interesting thoughts that I should incorporate somehow with the addition of
further explanation for the defects and methods used.
Key takeaways:
- Tpeak simulations differ due to ideal TiN vs real TiN. But is good
approximation.
- XPS shows a reduction of As2O3-defects in FLA by roughly half. Moreover, a
reduction of the As0-peaks (Metallic As) are also found in the fitting which are
known to be the main source of interface defects in InAs/high-k oxide
interfaces. These are especially detrimental for device performance.
- TiN is known to scavenge oxygen from HZO (TiOxNy). The improved endurance 
could be attributed to reduced thermal budget which limits the scavenging of 
oxygen by the TiN electrode. 
- Uni-CV and bi-directional CV are complementary. bi-directional shows interface
defects while Uni-CV integrates into the (full) oxide. I should have both!
- A higher defect density is observed for RTP however since it also has a higher
Pr it is not a straight forward comparison due to the increased band bending
(could introduce more traps). However, the 32.5 J/cm2 sample shows a
slightly higher defect density with a lower Pr which suggests the defects are
indeed related to the thermal budget.
- Increased ALD temperature is in itself somewhat detrimental to the HZO film.
This is shown by the defect density being lower in the 25J flash at 200C compared
to the 20J flash at 270C.

Short and efficient paper reporting on a ferroelectric phase of lightly doped
HfO2. 10 nm films in a MIM structure with and without capping are made and they
theorize a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic intermediate phase between the known
tetragonal and monoclinic phases.
Key takeaways:
- The tetragonal phase is usually not stable below 2050K. For nano-scale
structures it can be stable.
- Capping is the source to suppressing the monoclinic phase and the intermediate
orthorhombic can be stabilized.
- With GIXRD they fit measured peak data to a orthorhombic pattern. However, not
all orthorhombic phases are non-centrosymmetric and they draw parallells to the
ZrO2 system which does have a non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic phase.
- This is a remarkable duscovery at the time. HfO2 is CMOS compatible and could
unlock a great number of device concepts for the future.

Very interesting paper investigating the cause of the wakeup and fatigue of a
MIM capacitor. Both diffusion and phase transition is resposible where oxygen
vacancies diffuse to first create a more uniform field distribution but later
both diffuse and are generated to only cause pinning of the domains and
contribute to the leakage through the FE layer. The initial wakeup is also casue
by additional phase transitions primarily close to the interfaces.
Key takeaways:
- Stability of the switching is more important than high Pr numbers.
- Wakeup on the order of 10³ is common.
- No defects are generated during wakeup, the existing vacancies are
redistributed to create a more uniform field which allows for more domains to
participate in the switching.
- Since wakeup is diffusion driven it is temperature dependant --> A few cycles
at high temperature removes the need for wakeup.
- Cycling causes charge injection (trapping) in existing vacancies which can
either facilitate or impede the ferroelectric response. (de-/pinning domains)
- The redistribution of the vacnacies during wakeup does contribute to the
leakage. However, since leakage is strongest along grain boundaries this is
barely noticable.
- Additional vacancies are primarily generated at the interfaces which screen
the bulk and makes it harder to reach the coercive field of all domains.
- The generated vacancies can subsequently diffuse and trap charges which pins
the domains.
- Further cycling generates more vacancies which collect at the grain boundaries
increasing leakage significantly.
